# Queue
A simplistic queue system, written in Java, primarily for Bukkit.

# Current State
The project has not been thoroughly tested, nor is it completely finished. It was just a fun project to get back into coding again, but nothing serious. 
There might be some performance and/or QoL issues, and features lacking. I just cba to fix complete.
